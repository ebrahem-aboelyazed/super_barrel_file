**Dart Barrel Manager** is an IntelliJ-based plugin for Dart and Flutter developers that automatically generates and
manages _barrel files_ (also known as `index.dart` or `{folder_name}.dart`). These files help centralize your exports
and keep imports across your codebase clean, consistent, and maintainable.

<!-- Plugin description -->

## Features

- **Dedicated Tool Window**  
  Browse, navigate, and regenerate barrel files directly from a streamlined side panel integrated into the IDE.

- **One Click Generation**  
  Instantly generate barrel files for any folder or recursively across your entire project.

- **Highly Configurable Options**  
  Adapt the plugin‚Äôs behavior to match your project conventions:
    - Choose naming strategies like `index.dart`, `{folder_name}.dart`, or a custom file name.
    - Enable or disable automatic `export` or `import` statements.
    - Add custom header comments to generated files.
    - Exclude files using patterns such as `*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, or any regular expression.
    - Automatically sort export statements for cleaner diffs and improved readability.
    - Hide private members or selectively expose public APIs using `show` or `hide` modifiers.

- **Smart Regeneration**  
  Automatically detects when regeneration is needed based on file modification times.

- **Safe and Clean**  
  Avoids regenerating existing barrel files (like `index.dart`) to prevent recursion or conflicts.

## üí° Why Use Barrel Files?

Barrel files consolidate multiple file exports into a single entry point. This improves:

- Code readability and consistency across large projects
- Import simplicity, especially for shared or modularized architectures
- Refactoring ease when files are moved or renamed
